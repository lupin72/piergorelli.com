More than 25 years have passed since my first (and, to this day, only) personal website. I still remember the improbable background pattern and the Star Wars-style lightsaber separators. It was hosted on Jumpy, thanks to a CD-ROM I found, if memory serves me right, in a copy of ‚ÄúIo Programmo.‚Äù

The journey since then has been long, exciting, and at times, challenging. I witnessed the rise of floats (thank you for freeing us from tables!), the comical adventures with DHTML, the development of corporate websites in ASP with MS Access (üòÖ, yes, really!), the curses aimed at Microsoft Explorer, and the celebratory toasts for Flash‚Äôs funeral. From ColdFusion and Java to PHP, I was always tempted to shift my focus from the dark screen of the code to the browser, driven by my passion for design and minimalism.

Today, a quarter of a century later, my **site 2.0** is born. For the first time, what you see is a mirror image of what I envisioned. It‚Äôs not just a portfolio but a personal space where I can write, experiment, and share what I love.

This new version of myself is an invitation to embrace consistency‚Äîa value often underrated in favor of creativity. I hope this site becomes a place to inspire and be inspired.
