Working from home, managing your own schedule, and choosing the most stimulating projects: the dream of remote freelancing. However, behind this apparent perfection, there are unique challenges: endless workdays, isolation, and difficulty managing stress. Yet, with the right strategies, it's possible not only to survive but thrive in this work model. In this article, I share the lessons learned from almost 15 years (okay, 13, but I was told it's better not to say that ðŸ˜‰) of full remote work, with successes, mistakes, and small tips that made a difference.

## 1. Get organized!

When the 2.0 phenomenon exploded, with the boom of social networks and technologies, images of young programmers working from home appeared online, looking like a summer camp: laptop on the couch, snacks within reach, and working until late at night. _"Do what you love, and you'll never work a day in your life"_ was the mantra repeated everywhere.

In reality, this idyllic vision of self-employment is the first big mistake. Full remote work only works if you set rules for yourself, create a well-defined space, and don't let your personal and professional life blend into indistinct chaos.

### Psychological insight:
The human brain works better with clear habits and predictable routines. Without a clear separation between work and personal life, you risk overloading your mind, leading to stress and a decrease in concentration. Creating routines and dedicated spaces helps reduce cognitive effort, improving both productivity and well-being.

### Practical tips:
- **Create a dedicated workspace**  
  No matter how big or small: it could be a desk in your bedroom or a coworking space, but it must be reserved for work only. This improves concentration and helps your brain distinguish between "work time" and "relaxation time."
  
- **Follow a set routine**  
  Establish clear working hours and stick to them. This will help avoid working sporadically throughout the day and feeling constantly "on." Also, consider having a ritual at the start and end of your day to mark the transition between work and personal life.
  
- **Avoid the temptations of comfort**  
  Don't bring your laptop to the couch or bed, and don't save time by eating or drinking coffee in front of the screen. Creating clear boundaries between workspaces and relaxation areas improves both mental and physical health.

## 2. Train your body

The digital world is fascinating but full of surprises: sudden problems, challenging deadlines, Murphy's law always confirming itself. The first victim, in my experience, is always physical exercise. _"I'll do it when I have more time,"_ _"I'm too tired to go out right now."_ These excuses can easily become a constant until you realize that your body, deprived of movement, starts to feel the effects: back pain, chronic tiredness, lack of energy.

### Psychological insight:
Regular physical activity is one of the most effective strategies for reducing stress. During exercise, the brain releases endorphins, dopamine, and serotoninâ€”neurotransmitters that improve mood, increase motivation, and enhance concentration. Movement increases blood flow to the brain, stimulating creativity and decision-making skills.

### Practical tips:
- **Find an activity you enjoy**  
  The key to making exercise a regular habit is to choose something you like and can easily repeat. It doesn't have to be running or going to the gym: swimming, yoga, dance, martial arts... anything that helps you disconnect and energizes you.
  
- **Start with something simple**  
  If you're not into sports, don't complicate things: walking briskly for 7 kilometers is a great solution. You can listen to music, a podcast, or just let your mind wander. It's an active break that disconnects from problems and stimulates endorphins.
  
- **Incorporate exercise into your routine**  
  Schedule a specific time of day for movement, just like you would for a meeting. For me, the ideal time is after work: it's a way to "switch off" the productivity mode and restore mental balance.

## 3. Rest to perform better

The brain is a fascinating machine capable of extraordinary performance, but it needs proper maintenance. And rest is one of the main tools to keep it efficient. However, when working from home, rest is often the first thing to be sacrificed: skipped breaks, eating lunch in front of the computer, evenings spent fixing a bug or developing a feature for the next morning.

### Psychological insight:
The brain is not designed to work continuously. During breaks, it not only recovers energy but also consolidates information and improves decision-making abilities. Alternating intense work periods with regular breaks helps maintain focus and reduces the risk of mistakes. A rested mind is a productive mind.

### Practical tips:
- **Follow a break routine during the day**  
  Plan 15-20 minute breaks every two hours of work. During these breaks, get up from your desk, stretch, or take a breath of fresh air.
  
- **Tackle the most challenging tasks in the morning**  
  When the brain is rested, it has the highest capacity for concentration and problem-solving.
  
- **Practice physical activity after work**  
  Evening exercise is an effective way to release tension and rebalance both body and mind.
  
- **Read a book to improve sleep**  
  Before going to bed, avoid screens and notifications. Reading a book helps the brain relax and promotes deep, restorative sleep.

## 4. Donâ€™t believe the hype

The tech world is constantly evolving, a whirlwind of new tools, frameworks, or technologies promising to be the ultimate solution. The hype can make you feel obligated to jump on every bandwagon, risking time and resources without clear benefits.

### Psychological insight:
The brain is naturally attracted to novelty, known as the novelty effect. While useful for learning, it can also distract us from our main goals, leading to "tech overload."

### Practical tips:
- **Always abstract first**  
  Before adopting a new tool, ask yourself: What problem does it solve? Is it necessary for your projects?
  
- **Focus on the "what" not the "how"**  
  Fundamental principles often apply across contexts. A good programmer solves problems effectively rather than chasing the latest framework.
  
- **Adopt solutions aligned with your goals**  
  Choose tools based on your objectives, long-term utility, and compatibility with your skills.

## 5. Let the shit happen!

Uncertainty is the rule in remote work. Sudden client demands, impossible deadlines, and technical problems are all part of the game. Accepting chaos and planning a solution is more productive than trying to avoid the unexpected.

### Psychological insight:
Uncertainty activates the amygdala, leading to stress and anxiety. Accepting uncertainty allows rational thinking to take over, reducing pressure and preserving energy.

### Practical tips:
- **Learn to accept the inevitable**  
  When something goes wrong, stop, take a breath, and focus on solutions instead of complaints.
  
- **Disconnect**  
  In chaotic moments, stepping away from the problem helps clear your mind for a fresh perspective.
  
- **Communicate effectively**  
  If a deadline can't be met, explain the delay and propose a realistic resolution. Transparency builds trust.
  
- **Value honesty over personal sacrifice**  
  Excessive efforts at the cost of balance aren't sustainable. Honesty is more appreciated than burnout.

## Conclusion

Over the years, I've learned to ride the waves like a surfer in Hawaii. It's about recognizing the waves, managing the unexpected, and most importantly, having fun. It's not just about technique or endurance, but reading the context, accepting chaos, and turning it into opportunity.

In **Part two**, I will address equally crucial topics: upskilling/reskilling to stay competitive, the importance of networking, and managing isolation syndrome in remote work.
