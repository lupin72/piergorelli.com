You've just finished your studies, you know design principles by heart, you've read tutorials on how to translate theory into practice, and now you're staring at a blank canvas. After spending an entire day designing the hero area, you've carefully chosen fonts, colors, images, and CTAs. You present the best version of your work, but the silence from your audience tells you something hasn't clicked.

Don't worry, you're not alone—everyone has been through this. I call it **"the blank page syndrome"**, and the solution you presented is the **"Comic Sans effect"**.

## The blank page syndrome

The blank page syndrome is that feeling of being lost, frozen in front of an empty page, unsure where to begin. It's completely normal, and the first step to overcoming it is to embrace it as part of the creative process.

## The Comic Sans effect

The Comic Sans effect dates back to the early days of personal computers and home printers, when stores began creating advertising signs strictly on A4 paper, using every style available in Word and... Comic Sans for that "creative touch."

In this context, it represents what happens after you’ve been stuck with the blank page syndrome: the result of the anxiety to finish a project, combined with a tired mind. It’s when you rush to complete something just to get it done, sacrificing quality and thoughtfulness in the process.

## Before You Begin: the principles of design

Before diving into the **10 tips**, let’s confirm one thing: the principles of design are the foundation of everything. The key is understanding how to apply them on the web.
1. **Balance**  
   Achieving visual stability by distributing elements evenly, either symmetrically or asymmetrically. Balance ensures that no part of the design feels “heavier” than another.

2. **Contrast**  
   Using differences in color, size, shape, or typography to highlight important elements and create visual interest.

3. **Alignment**  
   Ensuring elements are properly placed in relation to each other to create a tidy and professional look. Alignment guides the user’s eye through the design.

4. **Proximity**  
   Grouping related items together to establish a connection and reduce visual clutter. Proximity helps users understand relationships between elements.

5. **Repetition**  
   Reinforcing consistency by repeating visual elements like colors, fonts, and patterns across the design. This builds a cohesive and unified look.

6. **Hierarchy**  
   Establishing a clear order of importance using size, color, typography, and placement. This helps users know where to focus their attention first.

7. **White Space (Negative Space)**  
   Allowing room for elements to breathe by intentionally leaving areas unfilled. White space improves clarity and readability while reducing cognitive load.

8. **Movement**  
   Directing the user’s gaze through the design using visual pathways or dynamic elements like lines, curves, or animations.

9. **Unity**  
   Ensuring that all elements work together harmoniously to achieve the overall purpose of the design.

## 1. Define what to say before deciding how to say it

The temptation to dive straight into the project and start designing is strong. It’s exciting to see an idea take shape on a canvas, but haste is a poor advisor. Every decision not made at the start will come back to haunt you later.

###  How to do it:
- Create a **clear and hierarchical information architecture** to translate the brief into a structured plan.
- Think in modules: break the project into reusable, flexible components that can adapt to different contexts and purposes.
- Ask yourself these questions:
  - What is the main message?
  - Who is the target audience?
  - What action do you want the user to take?
  - What are the priorities?
  - How will success be measured?
  - What constraints do you need to consider?

Once you have a clear idea of **what**, you can move on to the **how**: choosing or creating the interface elements that best support the project’s goals.

## 2. Limit the number of choices

When faced with a blank page, the infinite range of options available might seem like an advantage. However, in practice, it’s one of the biggest obstacles.

### Practical tips:
- **Fonts:** Use no more than 1–2 fonts—one for headings and one for body text.
- **Typographic scale:** Define a scale based on 16px:
  - Base: 16px
  - H6: 20px
  - H5: 25px
  - H4: 31px
  - H3: 40px
  - H2: 50px
  - H1: 63px
- **Spacing scale**: Create a progression using multiples of 4px:
  - Base: 4px
  - Step 1: 8px
  - Step 2: 16px
  - Step 3: 32px
  - Step 4: 64px
  - Step 5: 96px

This scale will help you:

- Manage white space effectively.
- Ensure logical proximity between related blocks.
- Create consistent visual separations between sections.

Limit the use of weights and styles in fonts. To distinguish between primary and secondary information, use size, weight, and color. A light gray is clearly secondary compared to black. This helps you avoid the Comic Sans effect and reduces the user’s cognitive load.

## 3. Copy, copy, copy

In music, we draw inspiration. In writing, we draw inspiration. And in web design... we draw inspiration! Creativity isn’t about inventing from scratch but about combining existing elements in an original and functional way. Don’t be afraid to look around and study the work of the best—this is how you learn.

Drawing inspiration doesn’t mean blindly copying; it means observing, analyzing, and understanding why a solution works.

## 4.Don’t fear the void: white space is Your best ally

Among the fundamental principles of design, white space—the empty space surrounding elements—is your greatest ally.

### Why it’s important:
- **Reduces cognitive load**: It helps users process information more easily.
- **Improves readability**: Content becomes clearer and easier to consume.
- **Guides user attention**: It directs focus to key elements.

### How to use it:
- **Start with abundance**: Don’t be afraid to use generous amounts of white space initially. You can always refine it later.
- **Manage symmetry and proximity**: Align related elements closely while keeping sections distinct.
- **Add rhythm to the layout**: Use consistent spacing to create a flow that feels natural.
- **Remove the unnecessary**: Strip away anything that doesn’t serve a clear purpose.

## 5. Don’t reinvent the wheel

In design, there are **well-established patterns** that adhere to conventions familiar to users.

### Examples of patterns:
- **Accordion**: Used to hide content and reduce visual clutter.  
- **Card**: Groups information into blocks, making it easier to scan.  
- **Zig zag**: Alternates content to maintain user interest and engagement.

## 6. Use a grid

A grid is the foundation of a balanced design. A **classic 12-column grid** is particularly versatile.

### Why use it:
- **Ensures alignment and symmetry**: Keeps elements visually organized.  
- **Provides flexibility and adaptability**: Makes it easier to adjust layouts for different screens and devices.

## 7. Typography is a game-changer

Typography is not just about readability—it’s about vertical rhythm, personality, and a crucial decorative element.

### How to get started:
- **Use precise typographic scales**: Define sizes that create a visual hierarchy.  
- **Play with vertical rhythm**: Maintain consistent spacing between text elements.  
- **Experiment with sizes and colors**: Add emphasis and variation to make your design stand out.

## 8. Don’t forget grays when creating a palette

Grays balance primary colors and enhance readability.

### How to create grays from your palette:
- **Reduce saturation**: Lower the intensity of the colors.  
- **Calibrate brightness**: Adjust lightness to fit the tone of your design.  
- **Create a harmonized scale**:  
  - Very light gray: `#E3EFFF`  
  - Medium gray: `#7A8691`  
  - Very dark gray: `#1B2329`
