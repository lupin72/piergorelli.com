When this site was still just an idea on Apple Notes, I knew I wanted to dedicate a section to book reviews. It reminded me of those afternoons spent in record stores, searching for the right albums to add to my playlist. Without the “filter”—the clerk who knew you and your tastes—finding the perfect music would have been much harder. And that was in a physical store—imagine the challenge online. 

This section is meant to be that filter: a guide for those who share my tastes or appreciate my way of selecting and presenting works.

The first book I’m reviewing is one that metaphorically "fell into my hands" (or, more accurately, into my Kindle) during a difficult time. It was a period of uncertainty, when the future felt dark, and I found myself in a loop of anxiety and pessimism.

**[*Hidden Potential* by Adam Grant](https://adamgrant.net/book/hidden-potential/)** is about unlocking hidden potential and fostering growth, offering multiple layers of insight. Grant delves into the mechanisms that enable growth, providing tools to facilitate the process. The book is also a great resource for leaders, as it offers valuable advice on how to identify “diamonds in the rough” within their teams.

The narrative structure is reminiscent of a TED Talk: each chapter starts with a real-life story that serves as a foundation to explain the scientifically grounded processes behind personal and professional growth. However, don’t expect an academic treatise—despite Grant's reputation as a renowned professor, this book is tailored for a broad audience. It’s approachable, engaging, and filled with practical insights.

One standout feature of Grant's writing is his ability to explain complex ideas in a style that is both enjoyable and meticulously crafted. Each chapter concludes with strikingly precise sentences—almost aphorisms—that distill the core ideas into memorable takeaways. These concise yet impactful conclusions not only resonate with the reader but also serve as anchors for the book’s key messages.

If you’re looking for a guide to unlocking your own potential—or that of your team—this book is an excellent place to start. It’s a compelling read for anyone who believes that growth and success are less about innate talent and more about character, learning, and persistence.
