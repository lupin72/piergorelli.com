Working from home, managing your own schedule, and choosing the most stimulating projects: the dream of remote freelancing. But behind this apparent perfection lie unique challenges: boundaryless days, isolation, and difficulty managing stress. Yet, with the right strategies, it’s possible not only to survive but to thrive in this work model.

In the [**first part**](/blog/freelance-and-full-remote-a-guide-to-surviving-part-1/) of this article, I shared lessons learned from almost 15 years of full-remote work, focusing on how to maintain balance and well-being. Now, I want to focus on something equally crucial: how to stay competitive, motivated, and—why not—have fun. In a world that’s constantly accelerating, professional growth comes through upskilling, the ability to choose projects that bring real value to us, and exchanging information with a network of people.

Like a surfer riding the waves, the secret lies in finding the right balance between control and adaptability, between discipline and flexibility. Here’s how to do it.

## Reskill / Upskill: keeping up in a fast-changing world

In a market that’s constantly and rapidly evolving, keeping up with the times isn’t just a goal—it’s a necessity. In an ideal world, we imagine a linear progression where experience and knowledge grow hand in hand. In reality, however, we often find ourselves running on empty, chasing deadlines and fixing bugs, while technical debt and anxiety silently pile up.

Realizing the problem is the first step to solving it. Online, you’ll find many cases of people in your same situation, talking about imposter syndrome and that feeling of not being good enough. Acquiring new knowledge is an investment in the future: it keeps your mind motivated, opens up new job opportunities, and reduces feelings of anxiety.

### Psychological insight

The human brain is wired to prioritize short-term activities, especially those perceived as urgent (like meeting a deadline or fixing a bug). This phenomenon is known as **present bias**: we tend to prioritize what’s immediate, neglecting long-term activities like learning new skills. However, ignoring upskilling can lead to a vicious cycle: the more you delay, the harder it becomes to catch up, and the more anxiety about falling behind grows.

### Practical tips

- **Use online courses on platforms like Udemy, YouTube, Coursera, or edX:** These platforms offer courses on almost any topic. Choose ones that give you a general overview and motivate you to continue.
- **Introduce updates to your stack in projects that allow it:** You don’t have to overhaul everything at once. Start with small incremental improvements, choosing projects with manageable deadlines or acceptable risk levels.
- **Refactor old projects:** Reviewing and improving past projects is a great way to apply new knowledge without the pressure of a deadline. Remember: the value lies in the journey, not just the destination.
- **Create real side projects:** Side projects are an excellent training ground for practicing new skills without client or deadline pressure.
- **Start a blog on topics you want to explore:** Writing is a great excuse to study. When you have to explain something to someone else, you’re forced to understand it deeply.
- **Contribute to open-source projects:** Contributing to open-source is an excellent way to learn, collaborate with other professionals, and build a portfolio. Start with some “good first issues” (tasks marked as suitable for new contributors) to break the ice and gain confidence.

## Do only what brings value to you

Not all projects or activities are created equal. To stay motivated and grow professionally, it’s essential to choose what brings value to you, both in terms of personal growth and professional satisfaction.

### Psychological insight

The brain is motivated by activities that feel meaningful and aligned with your values. When you work on something you’re passionate about or that feels important, your brain releases dopamine, boosting your motivation and sense of accomplishment.

### Practical tips

- **Define your values and goals:** Ask yourself what’s truly important to you. Do you want to grow technically? Do you prefer projects that let you express creativity? Or do you want to work on something with a social impact?
- **Choose projects that challenge you:** Working on projects that push you out of your comfort zone helps you grow and stay motivated.
- **Learn to say no:** Don’t accept projects just for money or out of fear of missing an opportunity. If they don’t excite you or align with your goals, you risk wasting time and energy.
- **Evaluate long-term impact:** Ask yourself if a project will help you achieve your future goals or if it will allow you to acquire useful skills for your career path.

## Real networking: building authentic connections

Remote work can be lonely, but that doesn’t mean you have to face it alone. Building a network of authentic connections is crucial for finding new opportunities, exchanging ideas, and staying motivated.

### Psychological insight

Humans are social creatures. Even if we work alone, the need for connection and belonging is deeply rooted in our brains. Having a network of people to share experiences and challenges with can reduce feelings of isolation and increase motivation.

### Practical tips

- **Attend events and join communities:** Conferences, workshops, and meetups (virtual or in-person) are great opportunities to meet like-minded people.
- **Collaborate with other professionals:** Working with other freelancers or companies can open doors to new opportunities and perspectives.
- **Share knowledge:** Write articles, participate in webinars, or create useful content for your network. This positions you as an expert in your field and helps build meaningful relationships.
- **Stay in touch:** Don’t just meet new people—nurture existing relationships. A call or message every now and then can make a big difference.
- **Work in a co-working space a couple of days a week:** It helps create new connections and maintain a link to the real world, which never hurts.

## From reactive to proactive: taking control of your time (and your life)

In freelancing, it’s easy to fall into the trap of being reactive: responding to client requests, meeting deadlines, and solving problems. However, to thrive, it’s essential to shift to a proactive approach, where you’re the one steering your career.

### Psychological insight

The brain works best when it has a sense of control and direction. Being proactive activates the prefrontal cortex, responsible for planning and problem-solving, reducing stress and increasing motivation.

### Practical tips

- **Define a clear vision:** Where do you want to be in a year? In five years? Having a clear vision helps you make decisions aligned with your goals.
- **Plan your time:** Dedicate time each week to activities that bring you closer to your long-term goals, like learning new skills or building your network.
- **Anticipate problems:** Instead of waiting for problems to arise, try to predict them and prepare solutions. This reduces stress and increases efficiency.
- **Be flexible:** Being proactive doesn’t mean having everything under control—it means being ready to adapt to changes and seize opportunities.

## From “I have to” to “I want to”: rediscovering the meaning of your work

How often have you found yourself doing something just because you “had to”? Deadlines to meet, requests to fulfill, repetitive tasks. It’s normal—it’s part of the job—but if everything you do is driven by extrinsic motivation (the need to “have to”), you risk losing the true meaning of your journey. To thrive as a freelancer, it’s essential to shift your perspective: turn that “have to” into a “want to.”

### Psychological insight

Intrinsic motivation—the kind that comes from genuine interest or alignment with a personal purpose—is much more powerful and lasting than extrinsic motivation, which relies on external rewards like money or recognition. When you find meaning in what you do, your brain releases dopamine, improving your motivation, well-being, and even the quality of your work.

### Practical tips for cultivating “want to”

1. **Find your “why”:** Before tackling a project or task, ask yourself: Why am I doing this? What does it bring me? Whether it’s the chance to learn something new, express your creativity, or contribute to something bigger, identifying a “why” will help you connect emotionally with what you do.
2. **Turn tasks into opportunities:** Even the most repetitive tasks can have meaning. For example, you can see a deadline as an opportunity to improve your time management or approach a problem as a challenge to find new solutions. Shifting your perspective can transform your attitude.
3. **Look beyond the task:** Don’t stop at the surface of what’s being asked. Every task can hold a hidden opportunity: to improve a skill, discover a new interest, or network. Ask yourself: What can I learn or gain from this? Looking beyond the immediate task helps you find value even in mundane activities.
4. **Celebrate small wins:** Big goals are achieved one step at a time. Every time you complete a phase, no matter how small, take a moment to acknowledge your progress. This reinforces your motivation and helps you stay focused on the bigger picture.
5. **Recognize how much you’ve grown:** Every now and then, pause and reflect on how much you’ve learned and improved. It’s easy to forget progress when you’re only focused on the future. This awareness will help you stay motivated.
